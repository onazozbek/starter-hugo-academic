Özlem Naz Özbek is a dedicated and ambitious graduate student at Özyeğin University, where she is currently pursuing her MSc in City and Architecture. Her thesis focuses on the intersection of migration and architecture in İstanbul, a city with a rich migration history and cultural diversity. Through her research, Naz hopes to gain a deeper understanding of how the city’s built environment has been shaped by its history of migration and how it can continue to evolve to meet the needs of its diverse population. Although she is at the beginning of her research career, she continues her research with great interest, especially in the context of migration, culture, space, and city because she believes that the cultural interactions that occur as an inevitable result of migration, change the urban space and the everyday life of both immigrants and local individuals of the city.\
Naz is passionate about using her knowledge and skills to create more inclusive and sustainable urban spaces. She believes that architecture can shape how people live and interact with each other, and she is committed to using her expertise to positively impact the world. In addition to her academic pursuits, Naz is also actively involved in community outreach and volunteer work, using her skills to help improve the lives of those around her.
